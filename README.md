Intro
-----
Hihowareya. This is a project that has its roots in the [InstaCaption](https://github.com/myoniles/InstaCaption) project, where it lived as a stepping block to understanding more complicated networks.
The main purspose of the separate repo was to create a network that may be reused by rewriting the data.py file and the test method.

How to Use
----------
Use the existing data.py as a template. To reuse the ff.py structure a user must rewrite the to_vector(), make_data_set(), and (if needed) the test method. More verbose documentation is currently being worked on.
